# Task implementation notes

## Introduction

Even though on the surface this project looks simple, there is a huge amount of details to consider when implementing it. While some decisions are rather straightforward, a lot of others require considering many alternatives. Oftentimes, there is no single best solution for a situation, but different solutions with different sets of pros and cons. If You see something unexpected or weird in the implementation, there is probably a reason for that. I would be happy to answer any questions that You might have, so please feel free to reach out!
